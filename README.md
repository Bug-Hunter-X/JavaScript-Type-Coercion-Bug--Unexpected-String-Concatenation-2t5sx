This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to type coercion. The `foo` function intends to add two numbers, but due to type coercion, it performs string concatenation when one of the inputs is a string.  The solution showcases how to explicitly check types or use a safer method to achieve the intended numerical addition.  This example highlights the importance of careful type handling in JavaScript to avoid unexpected behavior.
